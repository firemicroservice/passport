# 单点登陆
============================
本系统是基于 CAS 5.3.x 开发的  [here](https://github.com/apereo/cas-services-management-overlay).

# Requirements

* JDK 1.8+

# Configuration

`etc`目录包含的配置文件和目录需要复制到`/etc/cas/config`。

# Build

要查看构建脚本可用的命令，请运行：

```bash
./build.sh help
```

To package the final web application, run:

```bash
./build.sh package
```

To update `SNAPSHOT` versions run:

```bash
./build.sh package -U
```

# Deployment

- Create a keystore file `thekeystore` under `/etc/cas`. Use the password `changeit` for both the keystore and the key/certificate entries.
- Ensure the keystore is loaded up with keys and certificates of the server.

部署成功后，可以通过以下方法访问CAS：

* `http://cas.server.name:8080/`
* `https://cas.server.name:8443/`

## Executable WAR

将CAS Web应用程序作为可执行WAR运行。

```bash
./build.sh run
```

## Spring Boot

Run the CAS web application as an executable WAR via Spring Boot. This is most useful during development and testing.

```bash
./build.sh bootrun
```

### Warning!

Be careful with this method of deployment. `bootRun` is not designed to work with already executable WAR artifacts such that CAS server web application. YMMV. Today, uses of this mode ONLY work when there is **NO OTHER** dependency added to the build script and the `cas-server-webapp` is the only present module. See [this issue](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/8320) for more info.


## Spring Boot App Server Selection

There is an app.server property in the `pom.xml` that can be used to select a spring boot application server.
It defaults to `-tomcat` but `-jetty` and `-undertow` are supported.

It can also be set to an empty value (nothing) if you want to deploy CAS to an external application server of your choice.

```xml
<app.server>-tomcat<app.server>
```

## Windows Build

If you are building on windows, try `build.cmd` instead of `build.sh`. Arguments are similar but for usage, run:

```
build.cmd help
```

## External

Deploy resultant `target/cas.war`  to a servlet container of choice.


## Command Line Shell

Invokes the CAS Command Line Shell. For a list of commands either use no arguments or use `-h`. To enter the interactive shell use `-sh`.

```bash
./build.sh cli
```
